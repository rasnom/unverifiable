### status

Currently only displays my resume.

### overall dev plan

Add small features atomically until I have a good representation of the things that I am interested in and testing coffeescript in railsalso convenient places to put ideas and observaations as they occur.

## feature - ambient 

Today I was browsing the web with headphones, but nothing actually plaYing. I had finished a playlist and not started another, when I heard quite claerly the sound of someone swallowing. It was very odd. I examined everything that I had open, but could find no obvious clues. Optimistically I am assuming that it was a sound effect from an add hidden in the margin of some chrome tab rather than a wiretap hot mike blunder. Overall, vaguely unsettling.

I love vaguely unsetting. 

Let's do that again.

### technical side-goals
