      As a very small startup, we each wore numerous hats. My hats tended to cluster around product development, process improvement, quality assurance, and customer service. Essentially my mandate was to identify what was most important to our users and then new guide development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways my most important role was to repeatedly ask the questions, "What are our priorities?" and "Are we doing the things that would best further those priorities?", and to build structures to help us better identify and stick to those priorities.
